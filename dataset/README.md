# Course-AI-Design-Project

## Dataset Overview
This directory contains the dataset used for training the language model in the Course-AI-Design-Project. You have the freedom to choose your own dataset, model architecture, and training method. The goal is to create a model that can generate 10 different coherent and unambiguous sentences.

## Requirements
- The dataset must be suitable for training a language model.
- The dataset should be preprocessed and ready for use in the model training.

## Upload Instructions
1. Ensure your dataset is properly formatted and cleaned.
2. Upload your dataset to this directory.
3. If the dataset is large, consider using Git LFS to manage the files.
4. If you cannot upload the dataset to GitHub, upload it to a cloud storage service and provide a link in this directory.

## Detailed Instructions
1. **Dataset Selection**: Choose a dataset that suits your model's requirements.
2. **Dataset Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the dataset to ensure it is ready for training.
3. **Dataset Upload**: Follow the upload instructions to ensure your dataset is accessible.
